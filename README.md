The goal of this project is to develop a full-stack web application that facilitates property management for real estate agents and easy property viewing for buyers or rent seekers. The application will be developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack.

The application will have three main user roles: real estate agents, rent seekers and buyers. Real estate agents/ rent seekers will be able to add, edit, and delete properties, as well as manage their profiles. Buyers on the other hand, will be able to search for properties based on location, price range, and other parameters, view property details such as photos, floor plans, and descriptions, and contact agents for further information.


The following are some key features that will be implemented in the application:

- **Property Management**: The application will allow real estate agents to easily add and manage properties, including property details, photos, floor plans, and location information.

- **Property Search**: The application will enable buyers/rent seekers to search for properties based on various parameters, including location, price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other features.

- **Property View**: The application will provide buyers/rent seekers with detailed property information, including photos, floor plans, descriptions, and other relevant details.

- **Agent Contact**: The application will enable buyers/rent seekers to contact real estate agents directly through the application for further information or to schedule a property viewing.

- **User Authentication**: The application will require user authentication to access the features of the application, such as adding properties or searching for properties.

- **Responsive Design**: The application will be designed with a responsive layout to ensure a seamless user experience on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.


Overall, this project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for real estate agents and rent seekers to manage properties and for buyers/rent seekers to find their ideal properties without leaving the comfort of their homes.
